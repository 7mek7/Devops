What is Flask Python
Flask is a web framework, it’s a Python module that lets you develop web applications easily. It’s has a small and easy-to-extend core: it’s a microframework that doesn’t include an ORM (Object Relational Manager) 
or such features.
It does have many cool features like url routing, template engine. It is a WSGI web app framework.

Why is Flask a good web framework choice?
Unlike the Django framework, Flask is very Pythonic. It’s easy to get started with Flask, because it doesn’t have a huge learning curve.
On top of that it’s very explicit, which increases readability. To create the “Hello World” app, you only need a few lines of code.

example:
  from flask import Flask
  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.route('/')
  def hello_world():
      return 'Hello World!'

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run()
