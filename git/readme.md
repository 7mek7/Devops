 What is a git?
Git is a distributed version control system that allows developers to manage changes to source code. Using Git, developers can:

- Track changes.
- Go back to previous versions of the code.
- Synchronize changes between multiple developers.

 
 Git in Devops
Git have many uses in the DevOps :
1 Source code management
  Git allows teams to easily manage source code. Using Git, teams can apply changes continuously and easily share these changes with each other.

2 continuous integration (CI)
In the continuous integration process, new code is regularly added to the master repository.
This is done using tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, and GitHub Actions.
Git makes it possible to run automated tests every time a developer adds code to the repository to ensure that the new code is compatible with the previous code.

3 Continuous Delivery (CD)
Continuous delivery refers to the process of automating software deployment.
As the main code source, Git can be connected to deployment tools to push a new version of the software to the production environment every time the code is changed.

4 Management of branches (Branching)
Git allows you to create different branches to develop new features or fix bugs.
This allows teams to work on multiple features simultaneously without affecting the core code.

Improve cooperation
GATE increases collaboration between team members.
With features like Pull Request and Code Review, team members can review each other's changes and give feedback.

Monitoring and documentation
With Git, a history of code changes is recorded, which helps in better documentation and monitoring of the project.
This information can be useful for analyzing problems and checking the development process.

focus
Git is one of the essential tools in the DevOps process, helping developers and operations teams manage code effectively, collaborate more, and implement CI/CD processes.
This tool not only increases the efficiency but also improves the quality of the software.
