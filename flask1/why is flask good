Why is Flask a good web framework choice?
Unlike the Django framework, Flask is very Pythonic. It’s easy to get started with Flask, because it doesn’t have a huge learning curve.
On top of that it’s very explicit, which increases readability. To create the “Hello World” app, you only need a few lines of code.

example:
  from flask import Flask
  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.route('/')
  def hello_world():
      return 'Hello World!'

  if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run()
