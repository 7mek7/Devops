Microservices architecture is a software development approach that organizes an application as a collection of loosely coupled services
each designed to perform specific business functions independently.
This structure allows for greater flexibility and scalability compared to traditional monolithic architectures
where all components are tightly integrated into a single codebase.

Key Features of Microservices:
1 Independence: Each microservice can be developed and maintained separately, enabling faster development cycles and reducing interdependencies among teams.
2 Flexibility in Technology: Teams can select different technologies for each microservice based on their specific needs, allowing for a more tailored solution.
3 Scalability: Individual services can be scaled up or down based on demand without needing to scale the entire application, optimizing resource usage.
4 Continuous Deployment: Microservices support CI/CD practices, allowing for more frequent and reliable updates to the application.
5 Resilience: The failure of one microservice does not impact the entire system, enhancing overall reliability and fault tolerance.


Example1 : Implementing CI/CD with GitHub Actions

Goal: Create a workflow for building and deploying microservices.
